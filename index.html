                <p>The first rule of flag football is pretty straight forward: there's no contact allowed. That includes tackling, diving, blocking, and screening. Instead, players wear flags that hang along their sides by a belt. To "tackle" the person in possession of the ball, the opposing team needs to pull one or both of their flags off.</p>
                
                <p>While flag football rules are designed to keep players safe, you'll find that they also create an engaging, fast-paced version of football without the physical contact.</p>

                <h2>Official Game Rules</h2>
                <ul class="rules-list">
                    <li>All passes must be forward and received beyond the line of scrimmage.</li>
                    
                    <li>Direct handoffs as well as unlimited backward pitches and passes are allowed behind the line of scrimmage. No backwards passes or direct handoffs are allowed past the line of scrimmage.</li>
                    
                    <li>The quarterback has 7 seconds, from receiving the snap, to release the ball. Once a backwards handoff, pass or lateral occurs, the 7 second rule goes away and the offense has an unlimited amount of time to throw a forward pass.</li>
                    
                    <li>The player receiving the snap (QB) cannot run across the line of scrimmage with the ball. The QB can hand off or pitch/throw the ball backwards to a teammate and then catch a forward pass across the line of scrimmage.</li>
                    
                    <li>Offensive players must steer clear of the rusher and may not get in his/her way.</li>
                    
                    <li>A maximum of 2 designated defensive rushers may legally rush the quarterback. All designated rushers must identify themselves, with their hand raised until the snap, to legally rush from the 7 yard rush line. Designated rushers are not obligated to rush, but if they do, they must rush immediately upon the ball being snapped.</li>
                    
                    <li>Once the ball is handed off, pitched or thrown backwards by the offense, all defenders are eligible to rush across the line of scrimmage.</li>
                    
                    <li>Interceptions are returnable for 6 pts. during a scrimmage down or for 2 pts on any extra point attempt. A backwards pass intercepted in the air, behind the line of scrimmage, can also be advanced by the defense for a score.</li>
                    
                    <li>The ball is dead when it hits the ground, the offensive player's flag is pulled from their belt, the ball-carrier steps out of bounds, or the ball-carrier's body—outside of their hands or feet—touches the ground.</li>
                    
                    <li>All offensive flag football penalties result in a loss of down and yardage.</li>
                    
                    <li>All defensive flag football penalties result in an automatic first down and some are associated with yardage.</li>
